# svelte-session-store

With normal Svelte stores their value is lost if the user refreshes the browser.
This demonstrates persisting changes to a writable store in sessionStorage
so they are automatically restored on refresh.

To run this:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Add some numbers.
4. Refresh the browser to see that they are not lost.
